ZILCraft is a plugin which adds Zilliqa wallets to your Spigot Server.<br>
Players can create their own Zilliqa wallets and send transactions to each other within the game. They can even do so without needing to know the recipients address.<br>

## How to install

Drag and drop the jar file into your servers  _/plugins_  directory. Then, restart your server.  _**Do not use /reload, as it can cause intense memory leaks.**_

After the restart, you should notice a new folder called  _/ZILCraft_  in your servers root directory. This folder contains the config.yml and zilcraft.data files. The zilcraft.data file is used to store player information and can be backed up and transferred between servers.
